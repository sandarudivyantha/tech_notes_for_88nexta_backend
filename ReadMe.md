## For the backend of this MERN stack project, it covers setup with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for data modeling. Key features include RESTful APIs, authentication using JWT, role-based access, error handling with express-async-errors and cookies. Security is enforced through bcrypt for password hashing and CORS middleware. Environment variables are managed with dotenv. The project follows clean code principles and supports asynchronous operations with Express middleware.

## Frontend Code: Find the frontend repository and documentation for details on connecting it with this backend.
